        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello, user. I'm Carl, the creator of this website. Currently, I am studying Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at 
            James Cook University. My main hobby is playing video games, just like most 21st century men. The main reason why I'm studying Engineering is 
            because I want money. I'm not poor nor have I experienced any real financial trouble. Seeing those bank numbers go brrr makes me feel good.</p> 
            <p>As a wise man has said: "I don't get the way you guys think. I want MONEY. 6 figures right out of college. 200k a year entry level. I'm in this for MONEY. I don't care about whether I'm "fulfilled" I want MONEY. Whatever gets me the most MONEY. What do I need on my resume to get the most MONEY. 
            What technology gets me PAID THE BEST. All I care about in this major is MONEY. That's why I'm in college, 
            I don't wanna laugh and play with y'all. I don't wanna be buddy buddy with y'all. I'm here for MONEY." I hate spouting fake "I love this industry" etc. 
        Why can't I straight up say that I'm applying to jobs to GET PAID? I don't understand that.</p>

            <p>Enough about academics. The reason why I'm making this website in the first place is for people who are curious enough to click on my
                website from wherever I posted it from. Here they can see my personal projects, university projects and get to know me better. Kind of like 
            a 21st century business card. </p>
