        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello, user. I'm Carl, the creator of this website. Currently, I am studying Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at 
            James Cook University. My main hobby is playing video games, just like most 21st century men of my age. I also do read books that aren't related to university sometimes.
            What did you expect? The main reason why I'm studying Engineering is 
            because I want money. I guess I do kind of like the content, but that's how deep it goes. I'm not poor nor have I experienced any real financial trouble. Seeing those bank numbers go brrr makes me feel good.</p> 

            <p>As a wise man from the internet has said: "I don't get the way you guys think. I want MONEY. 6 figures right out of college. 200k a year entry level. I'm in this for MONEY. I don't care about whether I'm "fulfilled" I want MONEY. Whatever gets me the most MONEY. What do I need on my resume to get the most MONEY. 
            What technology gets me PAID THE BEST. All I care about in this major is MONEY. That's why I'm in college, 
            I don't wanna laugh and play with y'all. I don't wanna be buddy buddy with y'all. I'm here for MONEY."</p>

            <p> I hate spouting fake "I love x about y industry" bullshit. Why can't I tell the truth? Why did I apply to this company? Uhhh because it's related to my degree?  
            Why can't I straight up say that I'm applying to jobs to GET PAID? I don't understand that.</p>

            <p>Enough about academics. The reason why I'm making this website in the first place is for people who are curious enough to click on my
                website from wherever I posted it from. Here they can see my personal projects, university projects and get to know me better. Kind of like 
            a 21st century business card.</p>

            <p>
