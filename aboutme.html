        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello, user. I'm Carl, the creator of this website. Currently, I am studying Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at 
            James Cook University. My main hobby is playing video games, just like most 21st century men of my age. I also do read books that aren't related to university sometimes.
            What did you expect? The main reason why I'm studying Engineering is  is my interest in designing PCBs and working with embedded systems. 
            I’ve always been intrigued by how these systems drive modern technology, and i enjoy the hands-on process of building circuits that solve real-world challenges.
           </p> 

            <p>Enough about academics. This website isn't just a place to throw up my projects; it's for anyone curious enough to click the link wherever 
                I decided to post it. Think of it as a digital handshake or, you know, a 21st century business card. Here, you’ll find my personal projects,
                 university work, and maybe learn something about me that isn't buried in a resume. Hopefully, you’ll see why I do more than just tinker with circuits and code.</p>
